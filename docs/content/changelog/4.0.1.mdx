### New 🎉
- **Family shared game support**: Family shared games are now included in the "**Your Games**" page by default. Users can now idle and unlock achievements for games that are shared with them through Steam's Family Sharing feature, without having to manually add them one by one. Click the "**Refresh**" button on the "**Your Games**" page to fetch the latest list of games
- Added a new loader/splash screen that is displayed while the application is first launched. This provides a more polished and visually appealing experience for users

### Improved 🚀
- Links to SGI documentation are now opened in the user's default web browser instead of within the application itself
